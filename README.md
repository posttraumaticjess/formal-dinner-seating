# formal-dinner-seating
This is code written in Python to produce a csv list of randomized formal dinner assignments, including 31 waiters, 7 kitchen crew, and 252 students seated at tables.  
This code references a given csv file that includes a list of 290 student names from the 2018-2019 Cate School Academic year.
The kitchen, waiting, and seating assignments are completely random every time â€” the code does not take grade or previous assignments into account as of yet.
I worked with Kenzie, Kenzie's mom, and Will on this assignment.
